## Instructions
Make the Script Executable: Ensure the script is executable by running:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run_local.sh
Run the Script: You can start both scanners locally by executing:
```

```bash
./scripts/run_local.sh
This script will start both the public_repo_scanner.py and k8s_scanner.py scripts in the background and wait for them to complete. You can adjust the paths to the scripts if they are located elsewhere.
```
